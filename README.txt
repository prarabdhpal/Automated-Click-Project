# Automated Clicking Bot

## Overview
This automated bot is designed to perform automatic clicks when specific conditions are met. The project leverages the following libraries:

1. Pyautogui
2. Random
3. Time
4. Win32api
5. Win32con

## Project Functionality
The bot continuously monitors specific pixels on the screen. When any of these pixels display a red color value of 0, the bot moves the cursor to that pixel and performs a click action. Here are the details of its operation:

### Conditions and Actions:
- Pixel (X: 727, Y: 931): If the red color value is 0, the cursor moves to this pixel and clicks.
- Pixel (X: 887, Y: 931): If the red color value is 0, the cursor moves to this pixel and clicks.
- Pixel (X: 1035, Y: 931): If the red color value is 0, the cursor moves to this pixel and clicks.
